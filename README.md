## **Key Features**

### **1. Modular AI Agents**
- Agents capable of multi-modal task execution (text, image, audio).
- Autonomous decision-making through reinforcement learning.
- Collaboration and task delegation using a swarm-based framework.

### **2. Blockchain Integration**
- **Solana**: Native wallet creation, transactions, and smart contract interaction.
- **Ethereum**: Balance retrieval, token transfers, and decentralized logging.

### **3. Decentralized Data**
- **IPFS Integration**: Decentralized file storage and retrieval for transparent and resilient systems.

### **4. Swarm Intelligence**
- Collaborative decision-making using Redis-backed proposals and voting.
- Advanced consensus mechanisms leveraging Lua scripts and transactions for scalability.

### **5. Reinforcement Learning**
- Self-optimization using Q-learning for dynamic task execution improvement.
