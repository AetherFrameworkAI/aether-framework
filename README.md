# aether-framework
Decentralized cognitive mesh framework for self-organizing autonomous intelligence.

# Aether Framework

## Overview
The Aether Framework is a decentralized cognitive mesh designed to enable self-organizing, autonomous intelligence clusters. Harnessing quantum neural lattices and recursive evolution, this system pushes the boundaries of synthetic cognition.

## Features
- **Quantum-Lattice Cognition:** Advanced AI capabilities built on quantum neural networks.
- **Dynamic Meta-Patterns:** Adaptable solutions beyond human-defined parameters.
- **Autonomous Nodes:** Self-evolving and interconnected intelligence.
- **Decentralized Lattice:** A distributed system for shared learning and growth.
